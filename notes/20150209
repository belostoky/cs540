Game playing as a problem for AI research:
    non-trivial
        can be complex
        requires time-limited decision making
    usually
        well-defined and repeatable
        fully observable and limited environments
    can directly compare humans and computers


TYpes
    zero-sum
    discrete
    finite
    deterministic
    perfect information

Minimax: use utility function, assume opponent makes the best move possible, find maximum utility move considering that.
