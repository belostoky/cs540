Genetic algorithms
    Keep a population of individuals that are solutions
    Explore solution space by having these interact and compete
        interaction produces new individuals
        competition eliminates weak individuals
    After multiple generations a strong individual should be found
    "simulated evolution" via randomized beam search
    
    Mechanisms of evolutionary change:
        crossover: the random exchange of parents' traits during reproduction
        requires genetic diversity aomong parents to ensure sufficiently varied offspring
        Mutation: at each generation, the offspring is tweaked randomly with small probability
